# Outage-system
The outage system is a simple crud system that allows users to check if there are outages in their area, the search option uses a google geolocation API to determinr in which city the user is in and checks with the database if issues have been reported by admin, there is also a feature on the site that checks how many users from a different city have tried checking if there is a outage in the area.
